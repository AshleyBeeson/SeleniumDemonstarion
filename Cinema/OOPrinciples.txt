Encapsulation is used to protect variables within a system so that you have to access them via specific methods. i.e. If you declare a variable private it can now only be accessed by any methods that are created specifically for it commonly known as getters and setters. 

Inheritence is where one object inherits the values of its parent. i.e. We can define a vehicle as something that has an engine, some wheels and a fuel tank. As part of this a car is a type of vehicle as it shares the same properties but also has a boot. We could also say a motorcycle is a vehicle but isn't like a car but it shares similar things. 

Polymorphism is the ability to make an object have control of its data and how it used i.e. you could have a shape and it could have a Draw() method but what type of shape you declared when instantiated the variable.

Abstraction is used to strip an object down to its core code to allow for a decrease in complexity and an increase in effieciency. i.e. On a mobile phone you are shown the buttons you can press but not what happens.
